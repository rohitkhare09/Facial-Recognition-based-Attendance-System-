# Facial-Recognition-based-Attendance-System-
This is a Python-based attendance system that uses face recognition to automate attendance marking. Built with a Tkinter GUI, it is user-friendly and suitable for classrooms, offices, and workshops. Faces are detected and recognized using the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm, and attendance is recorded in real-time.
